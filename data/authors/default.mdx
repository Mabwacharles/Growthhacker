Welcome to my world of tech communities, where connections, collaboration, and innovation thrive! I'm Mabwa Charles, an experienced B2B and B2C Community Manager with a passion for fostering vibrant ecosystems in the realms of AI, Web3, and RPA.

With years of experience under my belt, I have honed the art of bringing like-minded individuals together, igniting conversations, and driving meaningful engagement in both B2B and B2C settings. I believe in the power of community to accelerate learning, spark creativity, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

As a Tech Community Manager, my mission is to create spaces where enthusiasts, experts, and newcomers can connect, learn, and collaborate, be it in business-to-business or business-to-consumer environments. Whether it's organizing hackathons, hosting webinars, facilitating Twitter spaces, hosting AMAâ€™s and lunch and learn sessions or curating thought-provoking discussions, I thrive on building bridges that connect individuals and ideas.

AI, Web3, and RPA are not just buzzwords for me; they represent transformative technologies that have the potential to shape the future. I'm dedicated to nurturing inclusive communities that foster knowledge-sharing, drive innovation, and empower individuals to unlock their full potential, both in the B2B and B2C sectors.

Connect with me and let's create something extraordinary in the world of AI, Web3, and RPA. Together, we'll drive engagement, foster innovation, and build a thriving tech community. Let's make an impact!
