### Weekend Odyssey: Riding the Blocktrain to Web3 Success!

This weekend was nothing short of a thrilling adventure as I embarked on a journey that took me from Nairobi to the enchanting ETHSafari Conference in Kilifi, proudly representing Celo Foundation. Picture this: a Blocktrain Ride through the heart of Africa, where the tracks led us to a conference venue nestled Beneath the Baobab. The rhythmic clatter of the train wheels was like therapy, and the windows offered glimpses of majestic wild animals at Tsavo National Park. As the sun dipped below the Nyika plateau on the horizon, it painted a mesmerizing backdrop for an unforgettable weekend.
The train ride was more than just a commute; it was a social playground. Engaging conversations and networking with fellow passengers set the perfect stage for the upcoming conference, which kicked off on Friday morning beneath the ancient Baobab trees.

### Day 2: A Web3 Extravaganza!

Friday was a day for the books! Imagine being surrounded by a dynamic assembly of Web3 pioneers, creators, founders, enthusiasts, and proactive minds, all congregating beneath the towering Baobabs. The day was a symphony of knowledge-sharing through captivating keynotes, thought-provoking panel discussions, and vibrant booth sessions.Various Networks and Protocols from the Web3 universe showcased their innovative products and services, aiming to entice new users into their realms.
In the midst of this bustling hive of activity, I proudly represented the Celo Africa DAO team. Our mission: to onboard users to Celo Foundation and the newly launched Minipay, a dollar stablecoin wallet. I led the charge in onboarding users through engaging booth sessions, and fostering meaningful social connections.

### Day 3: A Grand Finale and Celebration!

Saturday was the climax of this extraordinary journey. More participants joined the conference, and more users were introduced into the diverse world of Web3 protocols. The weekend concluded with an epic afterparty at the Baobab Deck, where we unwound from the whirlwind of activities.
The conference was a resounding success, marked by a multitude of achievements. Over two action-packed days, we achieved the remarkable feat of onboarding over 1000 new users into the Celo ecosystem, embracing the Minipay wallet with open arms. This milestone speaks volumes about our effective outreach and engagement strategies, showcasing the growing allure of Celo within the #Web3 community. It positions the Celo Foundation for continued growth and impact in the blockchain landscape.

### Conclusion

In essence, this weekend was not just a conference; it was a transformative journey beneath the Baobabs, a journey that expanded horizons, forged connections, and propelled the Web3 ecosystem to new heights.

Looking forward to the amazing experience EthSafari 2024 has in store.
