Cross-chain interoperability is a technology that enables different blockchains to communicate and interact with each other. This allows for the transfer of data and assets between disparate systems, providing increased connectivity and seamless integration without having to go through a centralized intermediary.

Cross-chain interoperability enables smart contracts on distinct blockchain networks to interact with one another without the necessity of transferring tokens across these networks.

There are a number of different ways to achieve cross-chain interoperability. One common approach is to use a cross-chain bridge. A cross-chain bridge is a smart contract that allows users to lock their assets on one blockchain and mint equivalent tokens on another blockchain. The tokens can then be used on the second blockchain, and can be redeemed for the original assets at a later time.
