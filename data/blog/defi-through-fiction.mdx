### Traditional Finance (TradFi)

In the world of DeFi the term used to refer to the other pre-existing financial services sector is TradFi, which is short for Traditional Finance, or Cefi, short for Centralized Finance. It encompasses a wide range of financial activities and institutions that have been in existence for many years. Traditional finance relies on a network of regulated institutions like banks, brokerages, and insurance companies. These institutions operate under strict regulations and guidelines, providing a sense of security and stability for users. Unlike newer systems like decentralized finance (DeFi), traditional finance is centralized. This means that a small group of institutions controls the flow of money and assets. This is hence a disadvantage in terms of accessibility and transparency. The main types of institutions here are central banks, brokerages, commercial banks, insurance agencies and financial service providers.

#### Drawbacks of TradFi (Traditional Finance)

The deficiencies of TradiFi are plentiful and range from:

<ol>
  <li>
    Financial exclusion for the unbanked - As of 2022, approximately 2 billion adults remain
    unbanked, meaning they lack access to an account at a financial institution or through a mobile
    money provider, this number represents about 38% of the world's adult population. The situation
    is however dire in Africa as approximately 340 million adults are unbanked and underserved, this
    number represents more than half of the adult population in the region, narrowing down to Kenya,
    approximately 4.8 million adults remain unbanked this number represents 16.3% of the adult
    population aged 15 and above.
  </li>
  <li>
    High intermediary costs - Traditional finance is associated with significant transaction costs,
    including fees for banking services, brokerage commissions, and other charges. These costs can
    erode returns for investors and make financial services less affordable for some individuals.
    According to the world bank's remittance prices the average cost of sending remittances through
    banks and traditional finance is around 6.20% of the transaction amount which rises to
    10.53%.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    Slow Speeds - The processes involved in traditional finance can be time-consuming. For example,
    settling securities transactions can take days, and cross border transactions may also require
    several business days. This slowness can be a hindrance in an era where speed and efficiency are
    increasingly valued.
  </li>
  <li>
    Centralized Control: Traditional finance is often characterized by centralized control, where a
    few large institutions wield significant influence. This concentration of power can lead to
    systemic risks and poses challenges for fostering a more decentralized and resilient financial
    system.
  </li>
  <li>Currency manipulation through unbridled money printing in the economies</li>
  <li>
    Dependency on Intermediaries: Traditional finance relies heavily on intermediaries such as banks
    and financial institutions. While these intermediaries play a crucial role in facilitating
    transactions, their involvement can introduce additional layers of bureaucracy, complexity, and
    potential points of failure.
  </li>
</ol>

While traditional finance has been the dominant approach for many years, the financial industry has witnessed significant changes and innovations in recent times. The emergence of financial technology (fintech) and decentralized finance (DeFi) has challenged some of the traditional practices, introducing new ways of accessing financial services and managing assets.

#### So what is Decentralized Finance?

DeFi alias Decentralized Finance has emerged as a new form of modern finance that aims to create a more open, inclusive, and transparent financial system without relying on traditional intermediaries like banks, brokerages, commercial institutions and other centralized institutions.

DeFi is distinct from fintech due to its open, permissionless and transparent nature.

Defi is part of the broader ecosystem of blockchain backed financial innovations which started with Bitcoins redefining of peer to peer payments and the concept of store of value. Ethereum, through smart contracts, set the foundations for dApps (Decentralized Applications) and DeFi.

DeFi began by replicating services found in the traditional financial sector, such as payments, exchanges, borrowing, and lending, but has since then introduced new innovations such as DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), Stablecoins, Derivatives, Prediction markets, Identity Management, Fractional ownership just to mention but a few.

DeFi applications are built on top of decentralized blockchain networks. As such it inherits the properties of those systems.

#### We have introduced another concept, BLOCKCHAIN, so what is blockchain?

A blockchain is an append-only ledger of transactions grouped into blocks, that is distributed between peers in a way that each participant can verify it on their own. Updating the ledger usually requires solving Byzantine Agreements with economically incentivized participation, secured by Cryptography.

#### DeFi Global Market Size:

The rise of DeFi took the crypto world by surprise during the summer of 2020 so much that we refer to the period as the DeFi summer of 2020. The DeFi market size is estimated to be around 9.4 billion dollars as of 2021, according to BCC Research, however some estimates suggest the market could reach 70.3 billion dollars by 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.5% over the next few years.

Total value Locked (TVL), which is a measure of the amount of capital locked inside DeFi protocols, is estimated at 46.7 billion dollars, according to DeFi Llama as at the time of writing this article which is 16th January 2024.
Market capitalization: This refers to the total value of all DeFi tokens in circulation. As at the time of writing this article (January 2024) the market cap of DeFi tokens is around 38.2 billion dollars, according to CoinMarketCap.

### DeFi Characteristics:

Decentralized Finance (DeFi), has several unique characteristics that differentiate it from traditional financial systems.

<ol>
  <li>
    Decentralization: At the core of it DeFi operates on peer-to-peer networks unlike TradFi which
    is reliant on banks and other centralized institutions. Financial services are offered through
    blockchain-based protocols, eliminating the need for intermediaries and empowering users
    directly. Records are kept simultaneously across thousands of computers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Permissionless: Anyone with a cryptocurrency wallet and an internet connection can access and
    use DeFi. No one may be denied access on the grounds of wealth, status, geography, credit
    history, or any other conventional barrier. This encourages equitable access and promotes
    financial inclusion. Users have greater control over their funds and can access financial
    services without the need for approval from traditional financial institutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transparency: All transactions on the blockchain are publicly viewable, creating a transparent,
    immutable and auditable financial system. Users can easily track their assets, observe protocol
    operations, and hold developers accountable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Security: For DeFi apps, blockchain offers a high degree of security. To reduce potential
    hazards, it's crucial to use well-established protocols and proceed with caution while working
    with smart contracts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Community Driven: Many DeFi protocols are driven by active communities of developers, users, and
    investors. This collaborative spirit fosters innovation, governance, and collective
    decision-making, shaping the future of the ecosystem.
  </li>
  <li>
    Interoperability: DeFi protocols are designed to be interoperable, meaning that different
    platforms and applications can seamlessly connect and interact with each other. This
    interoperability enhances the overall efficiency and flexibility of the DeFi ecosystem.
  </li>
  <li>Programmable: Developers can program the business logic into financial services.</li>
  <li>
    Liquidity Pools: DeFi platforms often utilize liquidity pools, where users can deposit their
    assets to provide liquidity for decentralized exchanges and lending protocols. In return, users
    earn a share of transaction fees or interest generated by the platform.
  </li>
  <li>
    Yield Farming: DeFi users can engage in yield farming, a practice where they provide liquidity
    to a DeFi platform in exchange for rewards, often in the form of additional tokens. Yield
    farming aims to maximize returns on invested assets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Smart Contracts: DeFi relies heavily on smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms
    of the agreement directly written into code.{' '}
  </li>
</ol>

| Interoperability - DeFi protocols are designed to be interoperable, allowing users to interact seamlessly with various decentralized applications (DApps) and financial services. | Centralization in Decentralized Systems - Some DeFi platforms may become more centralized over time due to governance structures or concentration of assets, potentially undermining the original decentralized ethos.           |
| Yield Opportunities - Users can engage in yield farming and liquidity provision to earn rewards, generating additional income on their cryptocurrency holdings.                   | Technology Risk - Smart contract failures, transactions cannot be processed due to capacity limits of underlying blockchain and Inaccurate oracle information or delayed oracle update                                           |

### DeFi Stack

The DeFi stack is a conceptual framework that describes the different layers of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. It is often visualized as a pyramid, with each layer building on the one below it. Here's a basic overview of the DeFi stack:
