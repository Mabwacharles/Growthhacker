### Introduction

Real World Assets alias RWA's are a class of crypto or digital tokens that represent physical, digital or tangible assets that get their value outside of the existence of a blockchain. They can range from Securities, indices, treasuries, bonds, real estate properties, Commodities and bonds.

RWAs allow these assets to find a place within the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, increasing the availability to these often inaccessible financial tools on chain. In tokenizing Real World Assers, you will be creating a digital twin for the RWA that exists on a blockchain.

Its possible to tokenize these financial assets, such as insurance, shares, securities, treasuries, equities, and indices beyond tokenizing traditional currencies. Tangible assets that can be brought on-chain are fairly limitless. Through tokenization, tangible assets can be represented as tokens onchain, allowing for ease of them being traded, bought, or sold

RWA protocols backed by money market funds, bonds (MMF), and equities dominate the market share in terms of total value locked (TVL), followed by RWA lending and real estate.

#### How are Real World Assets Tokenised

##### Non-native Tokens

<ol>
  <li>On-chain tokens are issued to represent Real Worl Assets that are managed off-chain.</li>
  <li>
    Presently, all stablecoins collateralized with USD exist in the form of a token that is not
    native to the platform.
  </li>
  <li>
    Given the early stage of RWAs, leveraging the existing financial infrastructure around asset
    custody is the more prevalent approach and holds an advantage.
  </li>
</ol>

##### Native Tokens

<ol>
  <li>
    A token is issued on-chain and functions as the Real World Asset itself. Put differently, the
    token does not represent any off-chain asset.
  </li>
</ol>

#### Advantages of tokenising Real World Assets

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Transparency:</strong> On-chain reflection ensures the accurate representation of an
    asset's true value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Asset owner distributions can be smoothly conducted through their
    crypto wallets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Liquidity:</strong> The inherent on-chain nature of blockchain allows for the trading of
    assets that were once illiquid.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Self-custody:</strong> Individuals retain control over their assets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Collateralization:</strong> Assets have the potential to be used as collateral on
    decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
  </li>
</ol>

#### Types of Real World Assets

Real World Assets represent a rapidly evolving sector within the crypto landscape. Here are some types of RWA

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to have a
    stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or the euro. Stablecoins try to
    tackle price fluctuations by tying the value of cryptocurrencies to other more stable assets,
    more commonly used is fiat currencies. Learn more about stablecoins

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Real Estate;</strong> Tokenizing real estate allows people to own a fraction of an asset
    like housing and earn income from it. Smart Contracts are able to manage tenant payments and
    property expenses thus democratizing real estate investing and making real estate accessible to
    anyone anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Commodities:</strong> Tokenizing commodities allows for democratization of commodities
    such as gold, precious metals, sculpture, paints, etc, hence asset holders can earn income from
    it. This can lead to the accessibility of the assets to users who are not able to access them,
    because of factors such as prices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Art and Collectibles:</strong> Blockchain enables the generation, ownership, and
    transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent unique artworks, collectibles, and
    antiques existing in the physical realm. The tokenization of art and collectibles allows for the
    division of ownership, enabling high-value art to be fragmented into fractions, thus reducing
    the cost of investment and making it more accessible.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Intellectual Properties:</strong> Creators such as artists, writers, and inventors have
    the ability to create digital tokens symbolizing ownership shares in the future revenues
    generated by their creations. Through the use of smart contracts, these tokens can be
    distributed, providing recurring shares of licensing fees or sales to early supporters.
  </li>
</ol>

#### How RWA are being used in Decentralized Finance?

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Trade finance:</strong> Tokenized invoices from businesses can be used as collateral for
    loans, providing access to working capital more efficiently than traditional channels.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lending and borrowing:</strong> Tokenized RWAs can be used as collateral for loans
    within DeFi protocols. This allows borrowers to access capital without relying on traditional
    financial institutions, potentially offering more flexible and affordable options. Lenders, on
    the other hand, can benefit from exposure to a wider range of assets and potentially higher
    returns.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Increased Yield Generation:</strong> Real World Assets can be integrated into various
    DeFi yield-generating strategies. For example, tokenized real estate can be used to generate
    rental income on DeFi platforms, while tokenized bonds can offer fixed-income returns. This
    expands the range of yield-generating opportunities available to DeFi users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Asset management:</strong> Autonomous funds protocols can deploy capital by trading RWA
    tokens, aiming to generate returns.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Less risky investments:</strong> RWAs grant DeFi access to alternative asset classes,
    not just crypto-related assets. Asset types linked to real estate, commodities, art, or other
    physical goods may introduce less volatility than crypto-native assets
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fractional Ownership and Liquidity:</strong> Tokenization allows for fractional
    ownership of assets, making them more accessible to a wider range of investors. Imagine owning a
    fraction of a Van Gogh painting or a luxury apartment through DeFi protocols. This increases
    liquidity for previously illiquid assets, opening up new investment opportunities.
  </li>
</ol>

#### How real-world assets tokenized

Real-world asset tokenization is the fascinating process of transforming tangible or intangible assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens essentially act as "digital twins" of the real asset, representing ownership rights and other associated interests.

### The steps involve

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Asset Selection and Valuation:</strong> This is the initial step in the process of
    tokenizing an asset that involves valuation of the asset to determine the total value, the
    assets can range from real estate, artworks, precious metals, Intellectual Property or financial
    instruments such as bonds, treasuries, equities etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Legal and Regulatory Framework:</strong> Regulations and regulatory compliance are at
    the center of every technology adoption and Tokenization of RWAs is not an exception. To ensure
    transparency and integrity of the tokenization process, RWAs often require establishing a legal
    framework outlining ownership rights, transferability, and compliance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tokenization Platforms and Standards:</strong>The next step involves choosing the
    correct blockchain and token standard for your valuated asset, different blockchains have
    different features, benefits and limitations, you must be able to evaluate your asset needs and
    select the correct blockchain to build upon, the different blockchains range from Celo,
    Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon etc. With selecting the right blockchain you must also select a
    token standard i.e ERC-20 for Ethereum, or SPL for Solana to define how the tokens behave and
    function within the blockchain ecosystem.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Token Creation and Distribution:</strong>The selected blockchain will thus be used to
    create digital tokens, typically to represent fractions of the real-world assets value. This
    will allow for fractional ownership and potentially wider investor participation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Secondary Market and Trading:</strong>Tokens representing the asset can be traded on
    dedicated or existing cryptocurrency exchanges, depending on regulations and platform
    specifications. This unlocks liquidity and potentially new funding avenues for the underlying
    asset.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ongoing Management and Compliance:</strong> Tokenized assets still require real-world
    maintenance, legal compliance, and regulatory oversight. Mechanisms are established to ensure
    these considerations are addressed while leveraging the benefits of tokenization.
  </li>
</ol>
