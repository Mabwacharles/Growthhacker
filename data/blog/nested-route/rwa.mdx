### Introduction

Real World Assets alias RWA's are a class of crypto or digital tokens that represent physical, digital or tangible assets that get their value outside of the existence of a blockchain. They can range from Securities, indices, treasuries, bonds, real estate properties, Commodities and bonds.

RWAs allow these assets to find a place within the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, increasing the availability to these often inaccessible financial tools on chain. In tokenizing Real World Assers, you will be creating a digital twin for the RWA that exists on a blockchain.

Its possible to tokenize these financial assets, such as insurance, shares, securities, treasuries, equities, and indices beyond tokenizing traditional currencies. Tangible assets that can be brought on-chain are fairly limitless. Through tokenization, tangible assets can be represented as tokens onchain, allowing for ease of them being traded, bought, or sold

RWA protocols backed by money market funds, bonds (MMF), and equities dominate the market share in terms of total value locked (TVL), followed by RWA lending and real estate.

#### How are Real World Assets Tokenised

##### Non-native Tokens

<ol>
  <li>On-chain tokens are issued to represent Real Worl Assets that are managed off-chain.</li>
  <li>
    Presently, all stablecoins collateralized with USD exist in the form of a token that is not
    native to the platform.
  </li>
  <li>
    Given the early stage of RWAs, leveraging the existing financial infrastructure around asset
    custody is the more prevalent approach and holds an advantage.
  </li>
</ol>

##### Native Tokens

<ol>
  <li>
    A token is issued on-chain and functions as the Real World Asset itself. Put differently, the
    token does not represent any off-chain asset.
  </li>
</ol>

#### Advantages of tokenising Real World Assets

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Transparency:</strong> On-chain reflection ensures the accurate representation of an
    asset's true value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Asset owner distributions can be smoothly conducted through their
    crypto wallets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Liquidity:</strong> The inherent on-chain nature of blockchain allows for the trading of
    assets that were once illiquid.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Self-custody:</strong> Individuals retain control over their assets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Collateralization:</strong> Assets have the potential to be used as collateral on
    decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
  </li>
</ol>
