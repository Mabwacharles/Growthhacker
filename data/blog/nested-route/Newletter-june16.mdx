### BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF

The US House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry has expressed his support for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. He [tweeted](https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1669489512840306688) on June 14, 2023, that he will closely watch the US SEC's response to spot Bitcoin ETF filing by financial services giant BlackRock's iShares. He also said that the SEC should not discriminate against Bitcoin ETFs just because they are digital assets.

The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is a proposed exchange-traded fund that would track the price of Bitcoin. It is the first Bitcoin ETF to be proposed by a major financial institution. The SEC has not yet made a decision on whether or not to approve the ETF.

McHenry's support for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is a sign that there is growing support for Bitcoin ETFs in the US Congress. In March 2023, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill that would direct the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETFs. The bill is currently being considered by the Senate Banking Committee.

If the SEC approves the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, it would be a major milestone for the Bitcoin industry. It would make it easier for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle. It would also legitimize Bitcoin as an investment asset.

### Stablecoin Race: DAI Surpasses BUSD Amid Binance-SEC Regulatory Row

DAI stablecoin, with a circulation of around $4.6 billion, has surpassed BUSD amidst mounting legal troubles for the worlds largest crypto exchange, Binance.

The market capitalization of BUSD has declined to $4.3 billion following the regulatory drama that started earlier this year.

<ol>
  <li>
    According to [data](https://coinmarketcap.com/) from CoinMarketcap, BUSD circulation is down
    over 70% since the beginning of the year. During the same period, the circulation of DAI has
    also retraced but by only 20%.
  </li>
  <li>
    BUSD was launched in 2019 under the umbrella of Binances Project Venus. Although the crypto
    exchange does not issue the stablecoin, it has been on a [downward
    spiral](https://cryptopotato.com/what-will-happen-to-binance-if-sec-manages-to-kill-busd/) for
    several months now.
  </li>
  <li>
    The first major blow to BUSDs trajectory was Paxos move to
    [stop](https://cryptopotato.com/heres-when-paxos-will-stop-minting-binance-usd-busd/) minting
    the stablecoin at the end of February at the direction of the US New York Department of
    Financial Services (NYDFS).
  </li>
  <li>
    In March, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed suit against the exchange for
    improper licensure and offering US consumers the wrong financial products.
  </li>
  <li>
    The subsequent lawsuit by the SEC against Binance forced the crypto exchange to
    [delist](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1668142704105259009) eight BUSD trading pairs from
    its margin trading platform.
  </li>
  <li>
    While BUSD has shown impressive resilience in the face of turbulence as it managed to maintain
    its position among the top three most dominant stablecoins for several months, however, the
    recent surge in burn rate finally pushed its supply below that of DAI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Zooming out, the persistent regulatory attacks on the industry have translated into a decline in
    the whole stablecoin market, which can be viewed as a sign of capital draining from the digital
    asset space and a troubling trend.
  </li>
  <li>
    This [weeks](https://cryptopotato.com/tether-cto-paolo-ardoino-alleviates-usdt-de-peg-scares/)
    deviation of USDT from the $1 peg further fueled FUD narratives, but Tethers CTO reassured users
    that the company is ready to redeem any amount.
  </li>
