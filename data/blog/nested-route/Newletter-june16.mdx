### US House Chair Supports BlackRock Bitcoin ETF

The US House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry has expressed his support for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. He [tweeted](https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1669489512840306688) on June 14, 2023, that he will closely watch the US SEC's response to spot Bitcoin ETF filing by financial services giant BlackRock's iShares. He also said that the SEC should not discriminate against Bitcoin ETFs just because they are digital assets.

The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is a proposed exchange-traded fund that would track the price of Bitcoin. It is the first Bitcoin ETF to be proposed by a major financial institution. The SEC has not yet made a decision on whether or not to approve the ETF.

McHenry's support for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is a sign that there is growing support for Bitcoin ETFs in the US Congress. In March 2023, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill that would direct the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETFs. The bill is currently being considered by the Senate Banking Committee.

If the SEC approves the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, it would be a major milestone for the Bitcoin industry. It would make it easier for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle. It would also legitimize Bitcoin as an investment asset.
