## What is DeFi and how does it work?

DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, refers to a financial system built on blockchain technology that aims to provide open, permissionless, and transparent financial services without relying on traditional intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions. DeFi platforms typically leverage smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules encoded on the blockchain, to automate financial transactions and eliminate the need for intermediaries.

## Basic overview of how DeFi works:

### Blockchain Platform: 
DeFi applications are typically built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Celo, Solana which provide a decentralized infrastructure for executing and verifying transactions.

### Smart Contracts:
DeFi protocols use smart contracts to define the rules and logic of financial transactions. Smart contracts are self-executing and automatically enforce the terms of the agreement, ensuring transparency and eliminating the need for intermediaries.

### Tokenization:
In DeFi, various assets, such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or even real-world assets, can be represented as digital tokens on the blockchain. Tokenization allows for easy transfer, divisibility, and programmability of assets.

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEX):
DeFi platforms often include decentralized exchanges where users can trade tokens directly with each other. DEXs leverage smart contracts to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority.

### Lending and Borrowing:
DeFi protocols enable users to lend or borrow digital assets, allowing individuals to earn interest on their holdings or obtain loans without going through traditional financial institutions. These lending and borrowing services are often facilitated through smart contracts and use mechanisms like overcollateralization to minimize default risks.

### Yield Farming:
Yield farming, also known as liquidity mining, involves providing liquidity to DeFi protocols in exchange for earning additional tokens as rewards. Users contribute their assets to liquidity pools, and in return, they receive tokens that represent their share of the pool's earnings.

### Staking and Governance:
Some DeFi platforms allow users to stake their tokens as collateral to secure the network or participate in the governance of the platform. Stakers can earn rewards for supporting the network's operations or have a say in decision-making processes through voting on proposals.

## Different types of DeFi applications?
There are various types of DeFi applications, each serving a unique purpose within the decentralized finance ecosystem. Here are some of the different types of DeFi applications:

### Decentralized exchanges (DEXs): 
A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a digital currency marketplace where users can acquire cryptocurrencies directly from one another over an online platform without the use of a middleman. With DEXs users can trade cryptocurrencies using DEXs without a centralized exchange. This may be a safer and more effective method of trading cryptocurrency. 
One of the fundamental uses of cryptocurrencies is the promotion of financial transactions without the involvement of banks, brokers, payment processors, or any other type of middleman.
These platforms enable peer-to-peer trading using smart contracts, giving consumers control over their money and lowering counterparty risk. Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap are a few examples. One thing all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have in common is that they execute orders on chain with smart contracts, and at no point do they take custody of users funds.

### How do DEXs work?
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance, Paxful and Coinbase, DEXs dont allow for exchanges between fiat and crypto, instead, they exclusively trade cryptocurrency tokens for other cryptocurrency tokens. However, centralized exchanges (or CEX) enable trading of crypto-crypto pairs like BTC to ETH or CELO to ETH, as well as fiat for crypto and vice versa. Additionally, you can frequently make more complex decisions, including placing limit orders or trading on margin. On the other hand, decentralized exchanges are nothing more than a collection of smart contracts. They employ "liquidity pools" to algorithmically set the prices of different cryptocurrencies against one another. DEX transactions are settled immediately on chain, in contrast to centralized exchange transactions, which are stored in the exchange's own database. There are three main types of decentralized exchanges: Automated market makers, Order books DEXs and DEX aggregators. All of them allow users to trade directly with each other through their smart contracts. The first decentralized exchanges used the same type of order books, similar to centralized exchanges.


## Decentralized lending and borrowing platforms:
These platforms let users borrow and lend money without a bank. Compared to typical loans, this method of borrowing money may be more affordable and practical.
On the other hand, DeFi lending protocols enable everyone to earn interest on supplied stable coins and cryptocurrencies. DeFi lending aims to offer a transparent, permissionless, and open-source financial service environment.

### How Does DeFi Lending Work?
DeFi lending mainly relies on the lending pools where the users can add their assets to the lending pool and ensure quick distribution among borrowers through smart contracts.
DeFi lending concentrates on providing crypto loans. This indicates that users don't need to worry about middlemen when locking their cryptocurrency assets on the DeFi loan platform. P2P lending enables the borrowers to choose loans directly from the decentralised platform.
Some examples of DeFi lending platforms:

  <li>Aave</li>
  <li>Cream Finance</li>
  <li>Compound Finance</li>
  <li>MakerDAO</li>
</ol>


## Decentralized stablecoins: 
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar. This makes them more stable than other cryptocurrencies. They provide stability within the volatile cryptocurrency market and offer a reliable medium of exchange and store of value within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

Some examples of stablecoins: DAI, cUSD, USDC (USD Coin), USDT (Tether),
