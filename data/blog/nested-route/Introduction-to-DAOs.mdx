### What is a DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a type of organization that is run by a smartcontract on a permissioneless blockchain.

DAOs are typically built on top of a public blockchain, which allows them to be transparent and tamper-proof.

A DAO operates on the principle of self-governance, where its members, whether individuals or asset holders, directly manage and decide on the organization's actions. These actions are carried out and recorded on the blockchain, a process referred to as onchain. Such actions encompass fund management, voting processes, and even adjustments to the DAO's governance parameters.

### Different Types of DAOs

DAOs come in different categories:

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Protocol DAOs</strong>: These DAOs are responsible for governing the development and
    operation of a decentralized protocol. For example, MakerDAO is a protocol DAO that governs the
    Maker protocol, which is a decentralized stablecoin system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Service DAOs</strong>:: These DAOs provide services to other DAOs or to individuals.
    These DAOs utilize blockchain technology and smart contracts to streamline service provision,
    eliminate middlemen, and improve transparency and operational efficiency.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Investment DAOs</strong>:: These DAOs raise funds from investors and different VCs and
    use those funds to invest in projects. For example, CeloAfricaDAO is an investment DAO that
    invests in promising decentralized projects around Africa.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Community DAOs</strong>: These DAOs are formed by a community of people with a shared
    interest.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Venture DAOs</strong>: Venture DAOs pool resources to fund early-stage web3 firms,
    methods, off-chain investment, and holdings that arent accessible through standard financial
    channels.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Grants DAO</strong>: DAOs designed to manage existing shared assets and work towards a
    common goal
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Alliance DAO</strong>: DAOs uniting broad coalitions to work on common issues, such as
    environmentalism and legal protection
  </li>
</ol>

These are but a few of the numerous DAO subtypes that exist. New DAO kinds will appear as the DAO ecosystem develops further.

### Features of a DAO

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Smart contracts</strong>: DAOs are typically powered by smart contracts, which are
    self-executing contracts that are stored on the blockchain.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tokenization</strong>: DAOs often use tokens to represent ownership or membership in the
    DAO. Tokens can be used to stake and vote on proposals, make payments, and access services,
    check out this [CeloAfricaDAO](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/85) proposal that was voted for.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Decentralization</strong>: DAOs are designed to be decentralized, which means that they
    are not controlled by any single person or group. This is achieved through the use of smart
    contracts and tokenization.
  </li>
</ol>

### DAO Tools

There are many different DAO tools available for creating and coordinating DAOs. Some of the most popular DAO tools include:

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Aragon</strong>: Aragon is a platform that allows anyone to create and manage a DAO. It
    provides a number of features, creating proposals, voting, treasury management, and governance.
    Check out the [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) platform
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>DAOstack</strong>: DAOstack is a platform that provides a number of tools for building
    and managing DAOs. It includes features such as voting, treasury management, and governance.
    Check out the [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/) platform
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Swarm</strong>: Swarm is a decentralized storage network that can be used to store data
    for DAOs. It is a peer-to-peer network that does not require any central servers. Check out the
    [Swarm](https://dao.swarms.finance/) platform
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Graph</strong>: The Graph is a decentralized indexing protocol that can be used to
    query data from blockchains. It can be used to index data for DAOs, making it easier to access
    and analyze data.
  </li>
</ol>
