### What is blockchain technology

A blockchain is a type of database that stores information in blocks that are linked together in a chain. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. This makes it very difficult to change or hack the data in a blockchain, as any changes would need to be made to every block in the chain.

### Blockchain Architecture

Blockchain architecture refers to the layers and components that make up a comprehensive blockchain system. Each blockchain layer plays a specific purpose, from data storage to network communication to system-wide consensus.

### Types Of Blockchain Architecture

#### Public blockchains:

Decentralized blockchains open for anyone to with an internet connection who wants to participate. Anyone can join a public blockchain and contribute to the network. Public blockchains are often used for cryptocurrencies, and NFT's such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Celo. Because of its decentralized nature, public blockchains are also called <em>Permissionless</em> and also <em>trustless</em> with its anonymous users.

#### Private blockchains:

Private blockchains also known as <em>permissioned</em> blockchains are owned and accessible to a select group of individuals or organizations. Only authorized users can join a private blockchain such as Hyperledger, Fabric, Corda. The restricted access of private blockchains tends to make them more attractive to enterprises who wish to keep some or all of their transaction information private.

With private blockchains the first block created is called a Genesis block and each block added afterward will have a cryptographic hash that refers to the previous block, allowing users to trace transactions and changes to information going back to the Genesis block.

#### Consortium blockchains:

Consortium blockchains are owned and governed by a consortium of organizations. Only members of the consortium can join a consortium blockchain. Consortium blockchains are often used for applications that require collaboration between multiple organizations, such as insurance claims processing.

As per the Blockchain Council [report](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/everything-you-need-to-know-about-consortium-blockchain/), the consortium owners possess the authority to modify or invalidate erroneous transactions while actively fostering collaboration among their members. Some of Consortium blockchains include: TradeLens, Voltron

#### Hybrid blockchains:

Hybrid blockchains combine elements of public, private, and consortium blockchains. Some examples include: Quorum, Ripple

### Components of a blockchain architecture

<ol>
  <li>
    Nodes: Nodes are computers that participate in the blockchain network. They store the blockchain
    data and verify new transactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transactions: Transactions are records of data that are stored on the blockchain. They can
    represent anything from financial transactions to property ownership records.
  </li>
  <li>
    Blocks: Blocks are groups of transactions that are linked together in a chain. Each block
    contains a timestamp, a link to the previous block, and the transaction data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consensus mechanism: A consensus mechanism is a process that is used to verify new transactions
    and add them to the blockchain. The most common consensus mechanism is proof-of-work, which
    involves solving complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the chain.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cryptography: Cryptography is used to secure the blockchain network and protect the data that is
    stored on it. Cryptography is used to encrypt transactions, verify signatures, and create
    digital signatures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Smart contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are stored on the blockchain.
  </li>
  <li>Chain: This is an ordered sequence of blocks</li>
</ol>
