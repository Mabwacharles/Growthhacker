### What is blockchain technology

A blockchain is a type of database that stores information in blocks that are linked together in a chain. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. This makes it very difficult to change or hack the data in a blockchain, as any changes would need to be made to every block in the chain.

### Blockchain Architecture

Blockchain architecture refers to the layers and components that make up a comprehensive blockchain system. Each blockchain layer plays a specific purpose, from data storage to network communication to system-wide consensus.

### Types Of Blockchain Architecture

#### Public blockchains:

Decentralized blockchains open for anyone to with an internet connection who wants to participate. Anyone can join a public blockchain and contribute to the network. Public blockchains are often used for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Celo.

#### Private blockchains:

Private blockchains also known as permissioned blockchains are owned and accessible to a select group of individuals or organizations. Only authorized users can join a private blockchain such as Hyperledger, Fabric, Corda. The restricted access of private blockchains tends to make them more attractive to enterprises who wish to keep some or all of their transaction information private.

With private blockchains the first block created is called a Genesis block and each block added afterward will have a cryptographic hash that refers to the previous block, allowing users to trace transactions and changes to information going back to the Genesis block.
