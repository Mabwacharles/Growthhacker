NFTs utilize smart contracts to establish ownership and ensure the uniqueness and scarcity of the digital assets.

NFTs are valuable in the digital world because of their uniqueness, allowing creatives, builders, artists and global brands to authenticate, sell, and trade digital assets in a transparent manner hence pushing the boundaries of NFTs. With the massive technology evolution NFTs have created new possibilities for artists, creators, and collectors, transforming the way digital content is valued, owned, and exchanged.
