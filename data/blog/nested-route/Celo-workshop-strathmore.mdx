### Introduction<br/>

Spearheaded and led the Celo Web3 Workshop 101, held at Strathmore University. The workshop was an engaging and informative event designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of Web3 and explore the potential of blockchain technology through the lens of Celo. The workshop aimed to equip attendees with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and navigate the decentralized world of blockchain.

The workshop began with an overview of Celo, a mobile-first blockchain platform that enables financial inclusion and empowers individuals through accessible, secure, and transparent financial tools. Participants were introduced to the core concepts of Web3, including blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps), and how these technologies are transforming various industries, particularly finance.

The workshop comprised a combination of theoretical sessions and practical hands-on exercises. Participants had the opportunity to learn about the Celo ecosystem, its key components, and how it differs from traditional centralized systems. They gained insights into the importance of decentralization, privacy, and user ownership of data in the context of financial services.

Hands-on activities were conducted to help participants understand how to interact with Celo and its functionalities. They learned how to create a Celo wallet, perform transactions, and explore the capabilities of the Celo blockchain. Participants were also guided on how to access and use decentralized applications built on the Celo platform, experiencing firsthand the benefits and user-centric nature of Web3 applications.

Throughout the workshop, there were interactive discussions, Q&A sessions, and networking opportunities to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among the participants. Experienced facilitators with expertise in blockchain technology and Celo guided the sessions, ensuring a comprehensive and engaging learning experience.

By the end of the Celo Web3 Workshop 101 at Strathmore University, participants gained a solid foundation in Web3 concepts and specifically understood the value proposition and potential use cases of Celo. They left the workshop with practical skills and knowledge that they could apply in their own projects, research, or professional endeavors related to blockchain technology and decentralized finance.

### Conclusion <br/>
