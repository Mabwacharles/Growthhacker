summary: 'The concept of "decentralized proof of personhood" refers to the use of data as a means of verifying and identifying individuals. It involves the measurement and analysis of unique physical or behavioral characteristics that can be used to distinguish one person from another.'

Proof-of-personhood is based on the concept of accountable pseudonyms. The idea is to link virtual and physical identities in a real-world gathering (e.g., a party) while preserving usersâ€™ anonymity. At the party every attendee is
issued one and only one proof-of-personhood token, without their needing to disclose any identifying information.

Proof-of-personhood system generates a roster of public keys, ensuring that each key is exclusively controlled by an individual human. In simpler terms, if you are a human, you can add one key to the list, but you are restricted from adding two keys. On the other hand, bots are entirely prohibited from adding any keys to the list.

Some Proof or Personhood projects currently in existence: Worldcoin, Proof of Humanity, Circles etc

In many proof-of-personhood projects including the projects mentioned above, the flagship application is built on UBI tokens where each user registered in the system receives some fixed quantity of tokens each day (or hour, or week).

### Usecases of Proof of Personhood

<ol>
  <li>Airdrops Distribution</li>
  <li>Voting in DAOs</li>
  <li>Token or NFT sales</li>
  <li>Quadratic voting</li>
  <li>Protection against bots and sybil attacks in social media</li>
  <li>Alternative to captchas for preventing DoS attacks</li>
</ol>

The aim to design open, democratic systems that prevent both centralized control by a project's managers and dominance by its wealthiest users is a recurrent theme in many of these situations.

### Forms of Proof of Personhood

<ol>
  <li><strong>Social-graph-based</strong></li> Social-graph based proof of personhood is based on the concept of Vouching and Verification it relies on analyzing an individual's connections within a social network or graph to establish their authenticity as a real person. In this approach, the system examines the relationships, interactions, and patterns within the user's social connections to determine whether they are genuinely human or potentially a bot or fake account.

By leveraging the complexity of a person's social network, this proof-of-personhood system aims to ensure that each individual on the platform is a unique human entity. Take for an example: If a group of verified individuals, let's say Sarah, Michael, Lily, and John, collectively affirm that another person, Jessica, is verified, then it is likely that Jessica is also a verified individual.

  <li><strong>Biometric</strong></li> Biometric proof of personhood is a verification method that relies on unique physical and behavioral characteristics of an individual to establish their identity. Biometric data includes various attributes such as fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, voice, gait, and even behavioral traits like typing patterns or signature dynamics. These characteristics are considered highly distinctive to each person and are difficult to forge or replicate.
</ol>

Most projects use a combination of the two forms of proof of personhood.

### Potential Risks of Proof of Personhood

<ol>
  <li>Privacy leaks</li>
  <li>Erosion of people's ability to navigate the internet anonymously</li>
  <li>Coercion by authoritarian governments</li>
  <li>Potential impossibility of being secure at the same time as being decentralized</li>
</ol>
