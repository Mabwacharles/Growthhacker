summary: 'The concept of "decentralized proof of personhood" refers to the use of data as a means of verifying and identifying individuals. It involves the measurement and analysis of unique physical or behavioral characteristics that can be used to distinguish one person from another.'

Proof-of-personhood is based on the concept of accountable pseudonyms. The idea is to link virtual and physical identities in a real-world gathering (e.g., a party) while preserving usersâ€™ anonymity. At the party every attendee is
issued one and only one proof-of-personhood token, without their needing to disclose any identifying information.

Proof-of-personhood system generates a roster of public keys, ensuring that each key is exclusively controlled by an individual human. In simpler terms, if you are a human, you can add one key to the list, but you are restricted from adding two keys. On the other hand, bots are entirely prohibited from adding any keys to the list.

Some Proof or Personhood projects currently in existence: Worldcoin, Proof of Humanity, Circles etc

In many proof-of-personhood projects including the projects mentioned above, the flagship application is built on UBI tokens where each user registered in the system receives some fixed quantity of tokens each day (or hour, or week).
