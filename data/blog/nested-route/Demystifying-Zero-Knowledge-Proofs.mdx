Zero-knowledge proofs is a cryptographic technology that allows a certain information or statement to be proved as true or not without actually revealing the information or statement itself, this enhances privacy and security in blockchain protocols.

Zero-knowledge proof (ZK proof) technologies enable one party to prove to another party that they know a piece of information without actually sharing the information with another party in order to prove their knowledge.

ZKPs are already being used by many DeFi projects to give customers better privacy and security for services like lending, borrowing, and trading.

### Fundamental types of Zero Knowledge Proofs

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong> Interactive ZKP </strong>: Under the Interactive ZKP the prover must complete a series
    of actions and tasks to prove to the verifier that they know and have a certain piece of
    information.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Non-Interactive ZKP</strong>: Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs do not require an
    interactive process between the prover and verifier. This types of ZKPs require more
    computational power as compared to Interactive Zero Knowledge Proof.
  </li>
</ol>

### The essential properties of a ZKP

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong> Completeness</strong>: If the input is valid, the zero-knowledge protocol always
    returns ‘true’. Hence, if the underlying statement is true, and the prover and verifier act
    honestly, the proof can be accepted.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Soundness </strong>: If the input is invalid, it is theoretically impossible to fool
    the zero-knowledge protocol to return ‘true’. If the statement is false, no efficient prover can
    convince the verifier otherwise, except with negligible probability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Zero-knowledge</strong>: The verifier learns nothing about a statement beyond its
    validity or falsity (they have “zero knowledge” of the statement). This requirement also
    prevents the verifier from deriving the original input (the statement’s contents) from the
    proof.
  </li>
</ol>

### Types of Zero Knowledge Proofs

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>zk-SNARKs:</strong> zk-SNARK stands for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument
    of Knowledge. They are a type of non-interactive Zero Knowledge Proof. They allow a prover to
    demonstrate knowledge of information without any interaction with the verifier. ZK-SNARKs are
    used in blockchains like Zcash, Loopring, and StarkWare to provide privacy-preserving
    transactions while still ensuring the validity of the transaction history.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> zk-STARKs :</strong> zk-STARKs stands for Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments
    of Knowledge, zk-STARKs are interactive Zero Knowledge Proofs that provide scalability and
    transparency. They enable the verification of large computations on the blockchain without
    revealing any sensitive information. The key advantages of STARKs over SNARKs are that they have
    fast prover times and are easier to scale as they offer more computing power.
  </li>
</ol>

### Why we need Zero Knowledge Proofs

There are several reasons why zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are important. We will demistify some of them below:

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Privacy And Security:</strong> Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) enable the verification of
    data without disclosing the underlying information, ensuring robust security and privacy. This
    feature proves especially valuable in scenarios where the confidentiality of sensitive data,
    such as financial transactions or personal identification, is paramount.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Compliance:</strong> Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) offer organizations the means to
    adhere to diverse regulations, including data privacy laws, while preserving security and
    privacy. Additionally, ZKPs can facilitate secure and private identity verification, ensuring
    compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scalability:</strong> Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) contribute to enhancing the
    scalability of blockchain networks by enabling transaction verification without disclosing the
    underlying data. Consequently, this reduces the volume of data that needs to be stored on the
    blockchain, leading to improved network efficiency.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interoperability:</strong> Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) play a pivotal role in fostering
    the interoperability of distinct blockchain networks through a secure and private mechanism for
    exchanging information among them.
  </li>
</ol>
