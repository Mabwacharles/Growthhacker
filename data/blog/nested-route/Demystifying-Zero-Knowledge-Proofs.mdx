summary: 'Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a cryptographic technique that can be used to prove the validity of a statement without revealing the underlying information.'

Zero-knowledge proofs is a cryptographic technology that allows a certain information or statement to be proved as true or not without actually revealing the information or statement itself, this enhances privacy and security in blockchain protocols.

Zero-knowledge proof (ZK proof) technologies enable one party to prove to another party that they know a piece of information without actually sharing the information with another party in order to prove their knowledge.

ZKPs are already being used by many DeFi projects to give customers better privacy and security for services like lending, borrowing, and trading.

### Fundamental types of Zero Knowledge Proofs

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong> Interactive ZKP </strong>: Under the Interactive ZKP the prover must complete a series
    of actions and tasks to prove to the verifier that they know and have a certain piece of
    information.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Non-Interactive ZKP</strong>: Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs do not require an
    interactive process between the prover and verifier. This types of ZKPs require more
    computational power as compared to Interactive Zero Knowledge Proof.
  </li>
</ol>

### The essential properties of a ZKP

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong> Completeness</strong>: If the input is valid, the zero-knowledge protocol always
    returns ‘true’. Hence, if the underlying statement is true, and the prover and verifier act
    honestly, the proof can be accepted.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Soundness </strong>: If the input is invalid, it is theoretically impossible to fool
    the zero-knowledge protocol to return ‘true’. If the statement is false, no efficient prover can
    convince the verifier otherwise, except with negligible probability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Zero-knowledge</strong>: The verifier learns nothing about a statement beyond its
    validity or falsity (they have “zero knowledge” of the statement). This requirement also
    prevents the verifier from deriving the original input (the statement’s contents) from the
    proof.
