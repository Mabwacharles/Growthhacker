#### What are Stablecoins?

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to have a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or the euro. Stablecoins try to tackle price fluctuations by tying the value of cryptocurrencies to other more stable assets, more commonly used is fiat currencies. Fiat currencies on the other hand are a types of money that are issued by a government and declared to be legal tender for transactions within that country, such as USD, EURO, REAL etc.

#### How Stablecoins Work

Stablecoins work by maintaining their value relative to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency or a commodity. They do this by tracking another assets price through a pegging mechanism.

#### Types of Stablecoins

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Fiat-backed stablecoins:</strong> These are the most common types of stable coins. As
    the name dictates they are backed by a Fiat currency such as Euro, US Dollar, Yen, etc. This
    implies that for every stablecoin in circulation there is an equivalent amount of Fiat currency
    in reserve, thus helping to keep the value of the stablecoin stable. Examples include, USDC (USD
    Coin), BUSD (Binance USD), USDT(Tether)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Crypto-backed stablecoins: </strong> Just like fiat backed stablecoins, Crypto-backed
    stablecoins are backed by Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Celo, Bitcoin etc. This means that
    for every stablecoin in circulation, there is an equivalent amount of cryptocurrency held in
    reserve, It's good to note that as the crypto market is highly volatile, crypto-backed
    stablecoins usually over-collateralize the reserves as a measure against price swings. Examples
    include, LUSD, DAI, MIM, RAI, TerraUSD (UST)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Algorithmic stablecoins:</strong> Unlike Fiatbacked stablecoins and crypto backed stable
    coins, Algorithmic stablecoins do not use any collateral to maintain their value, they instead
    use algorithms and smart contracts to manage and control the supply of the stable coins or
    tokens issued. This is usually done by burning or minting stablecoins, depending on the market
    conditions. Examples include, AMPL (Ampleforth), FRAX (Frax).
  </li>
</ol>

#### Stablecoin Usecases

Stablecoins offer various usecases to revolutionize how we handle our money. Below are just but a few Stablecoin usecases.

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>On-ramps/Off-ramps:</strong> On and Off ramps are platforms used to enter in to the
    Crypto ecosystem. On-ramps are ways to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat currency, while Off-ramps
    are ways to sell cryptocurrencies for fiat currency, all this can also be done through
    exchanges, brokers and P2P platforms such as Binance. Stablecoins bridge traditional finance
    (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), and help ease the transition into this new monetary
    system. Stablecoins are preferred by many DeFi platforms because of their stable nature compared
    to other Cryptocurrencies.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Digital Payments:</strong> Due to their highly liquid nature and ease of being swapped
    with fiat stablecoins can be used to facilitate speedy peer-to-peer transactions and payments.
    Users can send and receive payments without worrying about the price volatility associated with
    traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Remittances:</strong> Cross-border remittances can be costly and time-consuming when
    using TradFi Platforms. Stablecoins offer a faster and cheaper way to send money
    internationally, cutting down on fees and processing times. Since the Verification processes are
    done on-chain, this reduces transaction times from days to minutes.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hedging Against Volatility:</strong> Users can also use stablecoins to hedge against the
    volatility of cryptocurrencies. By converting their assets into stablecoins, they can preserve
    the value of their holdings. They can also take advantage of stablecoins to reduce the risk of
    price volatility in remittances.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Savings and Staking:</strong> Stablecoins can also be an alternative to a high-yield
    savings account, by offering interest-bearing accounts or staking opportunities, users can earn
    passive income on their holdings.
