#### What are Stablecoins?

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to have a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or the euro. Stablecoins try to tackle price fluctuations by tying the value of cryptocurrencies to other more stable assets, more commonly used is fiat currencies. Fiat currencies on the other hand are a types of money that are issued by a government and declared to be legal tender for transactions within that country, such as USD, EURO, REAL etc.

#### How Stablecoins Work

Stablecoins work by maintaining their value relative to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency or a commodity. They do this by tracking another assets price through a pegging mechanism.

#### Types of Stablecoins

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Fiat-backed stablecoins:</strong> These are the most common types of stable coins. As
    the name dictates they are backed by a Fiat currency such as Euro, US Dollar, Yen, etc. This
    implies that for every stablecoin in circulation there is an equivalent amount of Fiat currency
    in reserve, thus helping to keep the value of the stablecoin stable. Examples include, USDC,
    BUSD, USDT
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Crypto-backed stablecoins: </strong> Just like fiat backed stablecoins, Crypto-backed
    stablecoins are backed by Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Celo, Bitcoin etc. This means that
    for every stablecoin in circulation, there is an equivalent amount of cryptocurrency held in
    reserve, It's good to note that as the crypto market is highly volatile, crypto-backed
    stablecoins usually over-collateralize the reserves as a measure against price swings. Examples
    include, LUSD, DAI, MIM, RAI
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Algorithmic stablecoins:</strong> Unlike Fiatbacked stablecoins and crypto backed stable
    coins, Algorithmic stablecoins do not use any collateral to maintain their value, they instead
    use algorithms and smart contracts to manage and control the supply of the stable coins or
    tokens issued. This is usually done by burning or minting stablecoins, depending on the market
    conditions.Examples include,{' '}
